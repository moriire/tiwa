# Tiwa Web Application

## Project Overview
Tiwa is a modern web application with a Vue 3 frontend and a Python Django backend that serves as a RESTful API. It utilizes various technologies to create a robust web application.

### Frontend
The frontend of the Tiwa project is built with the following technologies:

- **Vite**: A fast build tool for Vue 3 projects.
- **Vue 3**: The JavaScript framework for building user interfaces.
- **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.
- **BalmUI**: A Vue component library for creating beautiful user interfaces.

### Backend
The backend of the Tiwa project is developed using the Python Django framework, with the following components:

- **Django Rest Framework**: A powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs in Django.
- **PostgreSQL**: An open-source relational database used to store data.
- **Gunicorn**: A Python Web Server Gateway Interface HTTP server.

## Features
Tiwa offers the following key features:

- **Frontend User Interface**: A responsive and user-friendly UI built with Vue 3 and BalmUI.
- **API Endpoints**: A RESTful API powered by Django Rest Framework for data management.
- **Database**: Data storage and retrieval using PostgreSQL.
- **Server**: Deployment and scaling using Gunicorn.
